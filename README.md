**PopCorn** is a modern, client-side web application designed for streaming local media files (videos and audio) directly in the browser. It combines a clean, aesthetic "glassmorphism" user interface with the powerful **Plyr** library to provide a seamless and feature-rich playback experience for your personal media library.
